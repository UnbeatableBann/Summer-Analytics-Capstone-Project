# Generative Text for Customer Support Automation

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system to automate customer support interactions using generative models. The system focuses on two primary use cases:

1. **Automated Response Generation**: To automatically generate accurate and context-aware responses to common customer queries, reducing the load on human agents and improving response times.
2. **Personalized Customer Engagement**: To create personalized engagement messages based on customer data and interaction history, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Use Cases

### Automated Response Generation

**Problem Statement**: Customer support teams are overwhelmed by repetitive inquiries that could be handled by automated systems.

**Solution**: Implement a generative AI model to automatically generate accurate and context-aware responses to common customer queries. This will reduce the workload on human agents and improve response times.

### Personalized Customer Engagement

**Problem Statement**: Customers expect personalized interactions that cater to their specific needs and preferences.

**Solution**: Use generative AI to create personalized engagement messages based on customer data and interaction history. This will enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Repository Contents

- `Generative_AI.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of generative models for customer support automation.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample customer support data and interaction history.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `requirements.txt`: The requirement document.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnbeatableBann/Summer-Analytics-Capstone-Project.git
   cd Summer-Analytics-Capstone-Project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Generative_AI.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and generate responses.

3. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to automate different parts of the workflow:
   - `preprocess.py`: Preprocess the customer support data.
   - `train.py`: Train the generative AI models.
   - `deploy.py`: Deploy the trained models for real-time customer support automation.

## Project Structure

- `Generative_AI.ipynb`: Main notebook for developing and testing the generative models.
- `data/`: Contains sample data files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
